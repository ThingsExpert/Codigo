# Zero Mega

Zero Mega is a project from Things Expert implemented in partner with Microsoft. In this repository you can find all solutions and scripts related to the project.

There are 3 folders:
- **Bash Scripts:** Here are the scripts in charge to send data from Linux Servers to Azure Event Hub.
- **Stream Analytics Scripts:** Here are the scripts for processing incoming data in Azure Stream Analytics.
- **ZeroMega**: The Visual Studio solution with the Zero Mega ASP.NET Web API.

## Running the solution:

### Prerequisites:
- Azure Account
- Azure Active Directory Tenant
- Microsoft Azure Storage Emulator

### Step 1.	Use Azure AD to store the account number as an Extension Property
1. Create an Application in Azure AD and called it ZeroGraph.
2. Get the Tenand Name, Tenant ID, Client ID and Client Secret.
3. Open GraphConsoleApp project and  insert your values in [Constants.cs](/ZeroMega/GraphConsoleApp/Constants.cs) file:
 ```cs
 public const string TenantName = "<Your Tenant Name>.onmicrosoft.com";
 public const string TenantId = "<Your Tenant ID>";
 public const string ClientId = "<Your Client ID>";
 public const string ClientSecret = "<Your Client Secret>";
 public const string AuthString = "https://login.windows.net/" + TenantName;
 public const string ResourceUrl = "https://graph.windows.net";

 ```
4. Run the project with F5.
5. Type and set the desired usersâ€™ account.

### Step 2.	Setup the IoT/Data Insertion Enviroment
1.	Create a Service Bus Namespace
2.	Create an Event Hub
3.	Create a Storage Account with General Purpose
4.	Use Microsoft Azure Storage Emulator and create:
  * BLOB Container called idthingsrd
  * Tables xDRTable and xDR2LogsTable
5. Upload the file Stream Analytics Scripts\2016-08-09-03-22-ref.csv into the idthingsrd container.
6. Create a Stream Analytics and set it this way:
  * Input 1: Event Hub
  * Input 2: Reference data idthingsrd
  * Output 1: Table xDRTable
  * Output 2: Table xDR2LogsTable
  * Query: Copy and paste the following content: (Also available in [Stream Analytics Scripts\query.txt](/Stream Analytics Scripts\/query.txt):

<!-- -->

 ```sql
 --Processing
 WITH ProcessedInput AS (
     SELECT
         CASE
             WHEN LEN(id_thing) = 17 THEN CONCAT('90', id_thing)
             WHEN LEN(id_thing) = 15 THEN CONCAT('8000', id_thing)
             ELSE CONCAT('X', id_thing)
         END AS id_thing, System.TimeStamp AS datetime_event, lat AS latitude, long AS longitude, dts AS date_event, tts AS time_event, anum AS numA, bnum AS numB, cgi AS CGI        
     FROM
         Labcom01in
 )

 --Output: xDR
 SELECT
     PI.id_thing, PI.datetime_event, Ref.account, PI.latitude, PI.longitude, PI.date_event, PI.time_event, PI.numA, PI.numB, PI.CGI
 INTO
     xDRout
 FROM
     ProcessedInput PI
 JOIN
     Idthingrdin Ref
 ON
     PI.id_thing = Ref.id_thing

 ```

> IMEI, IMSI, NumberA, NumberB and CGI are tipically values extracted from a GSM call.

<!-- -->
> Tipically, IMEI numbers has 17 digits, while IMSI 15 digits. The partner responsible for the design of the solution decided to make a standard 19 digits unique identifier, using the prefix 90 in case an incoming IMEI message, or 8000 if it is an IMSI one. Besides that, for log purpuses, if is not an IMEI or an IMSI case, an X prefix is added.

Your Stream Analytics topology should be similar to this one:
